Global Game Jam 2014 - "I am Mutsu, please save me"

Mutsu (for short) is a game developed at the Global Game Jam 2014, in Mar del Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina. It was the first time a GGJ was held in Mar del Plata, and of course, in Trick offices too (https://www.facebook.com/tricksoft?fref=ts)

This game is about a Gnome that has to save the forest by getting back his gems. 

Enjoy!
